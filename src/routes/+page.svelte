<h2>On snow</h2>

<p>Ah, snow at Christmastime — a reminder of nature's quiet resilience and beauty. As the delicate flakes descend from the heavens, they blanket the Earth in a pristine white, softening its contours and silencing its noise. It is as if the universe itself pauses, offering us a moment of stillness amidst the chaos of our lives. Snow speaks of renewal, of the cycles that govern our existence, and yet, in its ephemeral beauty, it beckons us to savor the present. During the Yuletide season, when we gather with those we hold dear, the snow becomes more than a weather phenomenon—it is a symbol of hope, unity, and the enduring spirit of humanity. As a starship captain, I have seen countless wonders across the galaxy, but few compare to the timeless serenity of snow on a Christmas morning.</p>
